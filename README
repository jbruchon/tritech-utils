This is the Tritech Service System utilities package.

These programs and scripts are what make the Tritech Service System far more
than just another minimal Linux environment. Most of the software is composed
of shell scripts, though some of the tools are partially or completely written
in C for performance or because a shell script isn't as practical; the simple
things done by the tss_file_tool program are a good example, because while a
shell script can slice up a sector on disk with 'dd' and match against a
pattern, it's a thousand times less messy to read into a C file buffer and
match it in memory.

These programs were written for my own personal use and needs, so you will
find many quirks if you try to throw them into use without the infrastructure
that I use them within. In particular, there is the concept of a TSS server
embedded throughout the scripts, though over the years I have worked on making
the system usable without a core server to support it. It is possible with
many scripts to pass environment variables which modify their behavior. For
example, tt_imagedrop looks for images in /mnt/cifs/source/hd_images by
default and IMGDIR overrides this: IMGDIR=/mnt/sdc2/diskimg tt_imagedropp

If you're interested in setting up a disk or CIFS server in such a way that it
can act as a TSS server, here's the expected layout of a TSS server root share
or portable TSS disk (with override variables in "QUOTES"):

/   (root of disk or share, "$BASE")
|
+-- customer_backups/
| Backup location for any customer data, used by tt_backup_cust_data
|
+-- mbr/
|   | MBR signature collection
|   |
|   +-- signatures/
|     MBR signature files for tt_scan_mbr
|
+-- source/  "$SOURCE"
|   | programs, disk images, stuff that won't change much (can be read-only)
|   |
|   +-- hal/  "$HALPATH"
|   | HALs for Windows XP images, optional
|   |
|   +-- hd_images/  "$IMGDIR"
|   | flat disk images for tt_imagedrop
|   |
|   +-- drivers/
|   |   | Windows driver collection, laid out for driver drop
|   |   |
|   |   +-- devicedb.txt
|   |   | Driver database text file, built by tt_build_dev_db
|   |   |
|   |   +-- [category_directory]/
|   |       | Windows driver categories (video, network, system, etc.)
|   |       |
|   |       +-- [driver_directory]/
|   |         An individual driver directory that can be copied by driver drop
|   |
|   +-- swdrop_sources.txt
|     A list of tt_software_drop categories, names, and locations
|
+-- packages/
  Tritech Service System software packages (if root of disk/share; optional)
